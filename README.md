# Stuff

I just finished the eJPT exam (fun!) and now I'm working on organizing my notes (commands, "cheat sheets," etc.) here in GitHub. While I'm doing that, I've started playing around with [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) for practice. 
- Next on my list is TCM's [PNPT](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/).
- But I gotta get my notes organized first...

Okay... from here down is basically just "notes to self" that I've dumped in here to look over and play with later on.

# I need a Python Cheat Sheet Repo...

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':     # Runs main() if file wasn't imported.
    main()
```

[`explanation`](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/if-name-main-python-example/)
- The variable __name__ for the file/module that is run will be always __main__.
- But the __name__ variable for all other modules that are being imported will be set to their module's name.
