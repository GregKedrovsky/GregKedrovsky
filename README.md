# Now

Outside of work, when I have some of "spare" time, I like to do things that are interesting and profitable. Right now I'm working toward the [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/). I'm following a path laid out for newbies in a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Pentester-BluePrint-Your-Guide-Being/dp/1119684307/ref=sr_1_1) I read. 
- I just passed the CompTIA [Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) certification exam (need terminology, concepts, etc.). 
- I am currently working through my "cert list," starting with [PenTest+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/pentest) (and I'm looking at [TryHackMe.com](https://tryhackme.com/) for "lab work").
- While I'm doing that, I'm also using Codecademy for "fun practice" and mini-projects to brush up on my "skills" (git, python, bash, etc.).

## Do the Thing

A recommendation from Daniel Miessler's [Unsupervised Learning NO. 336](https://mailchi.mp/danielmiessler/unsupervised-learning-no-2676132): 

> If you've been studying and planning to do something cool for a long time, stop it.
> Do the thing.
> You can still study after you're doing it, but don't let the studying trick you into thinking you're accomplishing something. You're not. It's a trick.
> Do the thing.

# My GitHub

This is the place I store all my projects. 
- Right now I'm working through Codecademy's git and GitHub course, so I have a lot of repos that will likely get deleted soon.
- After git/GitHub, I'll be doing some Python.

Okay... from here down is basically just "notes to self" that I've dumped in here to look over and play with later on.

# I need a Python Cheat Sheet Repo...

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':     # Runs main() if file wasn't imported.
    main()
```

[`explanation`](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/if-name-main-python-example/)
- The variable __name__ for the file/module that is run will be always __main__.
- But the __name__ variable for all other modules that are being imported will be set to their module's name.
