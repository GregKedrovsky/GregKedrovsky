# Stuff

I just finished the eJPT exam (fun!) and now I'm working on organizing my notes (commands, "cheat sheets," etc.) here in GitHub. While I'm doing that, I've started playing around with [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) for practice. 
- Next on my list is TCM's [PNPT](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/).
- But I gotta get my notes organized first...
