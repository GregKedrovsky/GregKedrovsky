# Now

I really don't like to be bored so I look for projects that are interesting. Right now, at this point in my life, I'm working toward the OSCP, following a path laid out for a newbie in a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Pentester-BluePrint-Your-Guide-Being/dp/1119684307/ref=sr_1_1) I read. 
- I'm currently studying for the CompTIA [Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) certification exam (need terminology, concepts, etc.).
- While I'm doing that, I'm also using Codecademy for "fun practice" and mini-projects to brush up on my "skills" (git, python, bash, etc.).
- Next on the certification list after Sec+ is [PenTest+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/pentest) (and I'm looking at TryHackMe.com for "lab work").

# My GitHub

This is the place I store all my projects. 
- Right now I'm working through Codecademy's git and GitHub course, so I have a lot of repos that will likely get deleted soon.
- After git/GitHub, I'll be doing some Python.

# Sandbox

Okay... from here down is basically just "notes to self" that I've dumped in here to look over and play with later on.

# I need a Python Cheat Sheet Repo...

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':     # Runs main() if file wasn't imported.
    main()
```

[`explanation`](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/if-name-main-python-example/)
- The variable __name__ for the file/module that is run will be always __main__.
- But the __name__ variable for all other modules that are being imported will be set to their module's name.
